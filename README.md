# CT-SAM3D Inference Pipeline
<!-- Towards a Comprehensive, Efficient and Promptable Anatomic Structure Segmentation Model using 3D Whole-body CT Scans. -->
> Author: Tianyu Lin

## News
- Update 09/29/2024:
  - [x] Sample point prompt(s) from postprocessed pseudo label for automatic segmentation:
    1. Get pseudo label from a pretrained segmentation model
    2. Conduct DAPAtlas postprocessing or my postprocessing method on pseudo label
    3. Sample a single point for each pseudo label as prompt for CT-SAM3D segmentation
    - Inference code in: `./ct_sam/notebooks/point2seg.ipynb`
- Update 09/22/2024:
  - [x] set environment 
  - [x] build test sample: can add dots and get Dice result
  - ~~[ ] visualization: NO VISUALIZATION~~
